January 29th at 5pm. I scheduled my JS assessment at that time. And it wasn’t until today’s morning that I noticed something special about this date. I hadn’t paid attention to the details of this date and time but somewhere in the back of my mind this date had a meaning already.

I come from Uruguay, a small country in Latin America. Nowadays it is one of the most enjoyable places in the world, with a quiet and peaceful life by the oceanside. 

But it wasn’t always like that. 

I grew up hearing stories from my mom and dad, telling me about many times they escaped the military regime and the dictator’s regime that ruled for a few years. I remembered this morning that exactly on Jan 29th at 5pm there was a call to all students at the time to gather and confront the military oppression, that obviously didn’t end nicely. People were killed and the story of that day was one of the many that were passed on to me… about that 5pm gathering on Jan29th. 

So 46 years later the memory of that fight is here. I am fortunate enough to not live in a dictatorship (we now have a democratic regime) and to choose freely about my life in every aspect, but still, it is education the one true way to put up the fight against oppression in every way. Because it is only through ignorance that we can be oppressed either by ourselves or others. 

I know for sure that this educational process has freed me from many of my previous conditionnements. Things that were holding me back in life. So I feel called to go out there today and rip it! To get one step closer to becoming a software engineer.

It’s impossible for me not to feel encouraged to “make it count”. Thinking about all those who didn’t have the chance like I do to choose freely. I feel compelled to share knowledge and opportunities, so that in the future there will be less inequalities. 

The Internet does have a big role in this play. I come from the country that implemented the “One laptop per child” education paradigm. In Uruguay, when you sign up for public school, you get handed a laptop for that new student. For real! 

So I think I might not be the only one who thinks that each child restricted from accessing education it’s a genius we lose. What would have happened to Mozart if he never had the chance to hold a violin? And even more, what would have happened to Music if no Mozart existed? 

We are collectively losing resources each time one of us is left behind. Like my old man says, the chain is only as strong as the weakest of it’s links. 

Let’s make today count!
