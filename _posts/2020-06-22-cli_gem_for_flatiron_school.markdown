Once it’s time it’s time, and the CLI assessment is here to tell you ‘it is time’ for your first step into your new self as a programmer. It’s here to tell you that you are no longer an impostor in this world of code and to remind you we all begin this journey with a blank page in front of us. 

CLI CLI CLI

Stands for Command Line Interface, or maybe...

Creative, Limitless Imagination.

As any creative process, it begins with an idea. Something that drives you, or even the mere unrest feeling that something new needs to be done. It all starts there. And from that point on, the only limit you are going to find is your own imagination. If you think it can be done, or if you think it can’t… you’ll be right in both cases. So be aware of where you are standing. Any negative thought might limit the outcome of what you craft and also any restrictive ideas about yourself and doubts might start to gain power if you let them. Stress less, in the end the worst that can happen is an error message to learn from.


Constant Loving Involvement

Learn to love what you do. This will make you better at it and a much happier person at the end of the day. As I was coding the CLI project I was also reading a book about Ancient Egypt Mythology which I find super interesting and totally love. So I thought I’d put both together and started writing the Thoth Tarot CLI. It is a CLI to get more information about Tarot readings from the Book of Thoth (which I was reading). That said, it didn’t feel like I was actually working at any point, I was just learning about two things I love. It surely helped to get through the hard parts of this project. 


Can't Learn Isolated 

I mean you can, but you’ll be wasting your time. This process also made me cross path with some amazing people. Generous and talent driven people. I don’t know why but people in code are just terrific. If you are willing to give your best you will find incredible feedback and you’ll be constantly learning from others ideas. You might look at issues from other points of view, or even shred light on things that were unclear before. It also makes the whole process a lot more fun. 

Come Look Inside

In my case the Gem is about Tarot card readings. Not that I I know anything about it, I’m just curious and there’s a lot to know about each card's meaning, so I thought I could make a Gem to Scrape from Tarox.net and learn more about them from the Command Line.
