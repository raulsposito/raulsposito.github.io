Woof! The Rails Project. Talk about a milestone. 

When I started this project I was the human being I was since I first born. I’m no longer that dude, this changed me forever. Like never before in my life I had committed to such a metamorphic process. Rails taught me so much about problem solving and self awareness, I guess it has to do with the fact that Rails is collective knowledge put to work, literally. That’s what it is, since it is a whole bunch of libraries compiled and following a set of conventions in order for a purpose to be fulfilled. 

Ok, so it’s day 1, I start the project, I have a weird issue with Webpacker. I move on to a new issue with the models and then Bcrypt, and then Omniauth. This starts to look like my life, and at one point, solving problems is always just that, moving on to a different scenario. Keeping your head up and staying motivated is a big takeaway from this as well. Since it can be frustrating, depending on what you choose to focus on. 

I started to really be aware of the things that supported me and my coding and the things that don’t, whatever habit it was. If going for a run every morning gets you into a good coding mood then go for it. It’s not time lost at all! 

I  also learned to stay true to myself and others. It’s ok to not do good all day everyday. It’s ok to respect that. Time is not only just quantity but also quality. Two hours of a “Good” working day can produce a lot more than two days of “Bad” working hours. So be true to it, one day you’ll kill it at something and such at it at the next one. Learn to leverage that and to always be moving forward on some field. 

As I was coding this App I also decided to finally leave my past job. During this period I committed full time to deliver the best results for me at Flatiron and to also learn a new mindset of creativity and resourcefulness. I had finally cut ties with all that I was professionally until that moment and aimed for the best version of myself.

So change it is! There’s still a lot more to do with the App. I’m sure I’ll revisit this a lot in the future and make it better. That should be a constant in life :)
